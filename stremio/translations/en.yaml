      Set this to a valid IPv4 in order to enable https and generate certificates with stremio domain. 
      If you set this to 0.0.0.0 it will try to automatically get your public ip. Getting the public ip and DNS is not reliable and might need multiple retries. It will not work for IPv6.

  auto_server_url:
